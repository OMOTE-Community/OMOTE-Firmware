* Config Module
The /Config Module/ for OMOTE introduces the option to define the
remote's functionality such as the controlled [[id:1670942e-7200-444a-992d-83effa554bc4][Devices]] and [[id:986aceb5-0da2-4742-b214-d283626730a4][Scenes]] in a
declarative way (using a YAML configuration file) instead of the
standard imperative approach based on defining the respective
configurations by implementing appropriate functions and data
structures as code.

Please note that while, in principle, the [[id:1670942e-7200-444a-992d-83effa554bc4][Devices]] and [[id:986aceb5-0da2-4742-b214-d283626730a4][Scenes]] defined
declaratively can live side-by-side with code driven definitions, it
is not advised as certain functionality (such as [[id:329ebe8e-23b2-4d34-9650-8ddbf8cc4c05][Device List]]
or [[id:5fe5b25c-59bb-4022-96a0-005d0a06de95][Automated Power on/off]]) will not be available for the imperative
definitions.


** Usage
To enable the /Config Module/ one needs to define the YAML_CONFIG build flag in
the =platformio.ini= file. Defining that flag has the following effects:
 1. The /Config Module/ dependencies (such as the ArduinoJson
    library) will be *conditionally* enabled and linked.
 2. The main YAML configuration file (defined according to the [[id:60e6d396-dd8a-4dd1-a145-da4f5abc01e3][Schema]]
    in a file named =config.yml= - see [[id:17207428-6f3c-4836-abf1-edd39fbfb37b][Example]] ) located in the main
    OMOTE project directory, will be translated to a header file and
    compiled into the binary.

The translation and conditional dependencies logic is located in a
script file under =tools/conditional_config.py=.

** Functionality 
*** Devices
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1670942e-7200-444a-992d-83effa554bc4
:END:
Devices defined via the configuration file (see [[id:60e6d396-dd8a-4dd1-a145-da4f5abc01e3][Schema]]) are equivalent
to the code driven definitions that live in =src/devices=. In addition
to the standard set of attributes and customization options inherited
from the imperative device definitions, the configuration driven
device definitions also allow to define a standard key-map for the
device (see =map_short= and =map_long= attributes in the [[id:60e6d396-dd8a-4dd1-a145-da4f5abc01e3][Schema]]) that
can be used as a convenient baseline for a scene key-map (see =scene= /
=keys_default= attribute) and will be used in the [[id:329ebe8e-23b2-4d34-9650-8ddbf8cc4c05][Device List]].

Each command defined within a device configuration, may also include a
new =category= attribute (see [[id:60e6d396-dd8a-4dd1-a145-da4f5abc01e3][Schema]]) that is used to enable the [[id:5fe5b25c-59bb-4022-96a0-005d0a06de95][Automated Power on/off]] capability.

**** Device List
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       329ebe8e-23b2-4d34-9650-8ddbf8cc4c05
:END:
The /Device List/ is a new top-level GUI screen which aggregates all
devices defined in the configuration file along with their
commands. This gives the capability (that would be immediately
familiar to any Logitech Harmony user) to invoke any arbitrary
command, from any configured device, even if it's not mapped to a
physical key.

The GUI presents as a list of devices which expand to the
list of their respective commands once a device is "clicked". As long
as a device is expanded, the physical key-map will be replaced with
the key mappings from that device definition (if available - see
=map_short= and =map_long= from [[id:60e6d396-dd8a-4dd1-a145-da4f5abc01e3][Schema]]). The key-map will be restored
to default once a device command list is collapsed
*** Scenes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       986aceb5-0da2-4742-b214-d283626730a4
:END:
Scenes, similarly to [[id:1670942e-7200-444a-992d-83effa554bc4][Devices]], are a direct analog to the standard
OMOTE's imperatively constructed "scene" entity. The config
file [[id:60e6d396-dd8a-4dd1-a145-da4f5abc01e3][Schema]] allows to define all the standard properties (including
"start" and "end" sequences) available in a classic, code driven,
scene definition.
On top of that the following additional capabilities are available:

**** Scene GUI
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f882865a-c45e-4173-b546-4d515822efd1
:END:
Each scene gets its own standardized GUI that gives easy access to the
scene's "shortcuts" (see below), ability to quickly swipe do the list
of devices (see [[id:329ebe8e-23b2-4d34-9650-8ddbf8cc4c05][Device List]])as well as a quick way to turn all devices
involved in the scene off.

**** Shortcuts    
The configuration file [[id:60e6d396-dd8a-4dd1-a145-da4f5abc01e3][Schema]] enables to define a list of "shortcuts"
for each scene that include semi-frequently accessed commands that for
one reason or another are not mapped to physical buttons but should be
available for easy access. The list of "shortcuts" is presented on the
[[id:f882865a-c45e-4173-b546-4d515822efd1][Scene GUI]].


**** Automated Power on/off
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5fe5b25c-59bb-4022-96a0-005d0a06de95
:END:
The /Config Module/ infrastructure tracks the devices that are being
turned on (via the =category= attribute attached to commands) in the
configured scenes' startup sequences and, as the user
switches from one scene to another, makes sure that:
 1. Only the devices required in particular scene remain turned on
    after switching from a previous scene.
 2. Only the devices that haven't been already turned on in the
    previous scene receive a power on or power toggle command.
 3. Only the devices that are actually on (that is used in the current
    scene) are switched off when requesting the "all off" function.

This is both handy and necessary in case of devices that are turned
on/off via a toggle command, as without that a device would be
inadvertently turned off if a new scene was requested that includes
powering on a device that have already been turned on in the previous scene.
